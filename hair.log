hair log
- extrude 10 instead of 20, 8 treads
	* good, as threads are spread apart, not tangling together or with the print head
- extrude 10 and 8, 20 threads
	* bad, threads don't get cut off from the print head, and get tangled together
	* but the threads feel more like hair
- tried two layers
	* had the problem of print head going back tangling with existing hair
-> tried reducing extruding amount from 10 to 5
-> tried adding retraction amount from 1 to 3
	* tangling seems better
-> tried to do the go-around thing
	* solves the tangling 
-> randomly go out
