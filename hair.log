hair log
- extrude 10 instead of 20, 8 treads
	* good, as threads are spread apart, not tangling together or with the print head
- extrude 10 and 8, 20 threads
	* bad, threads don't get cut off from the print head, and get tangled together
	* but the threads feel more like hair
- tried two layers
	* had the problem of print head going back tangling with existing hair
-> tried reducing extruding amount from 10 to 5
-> tried adding retraction amount from 1 to 3
	* tangling seems better
-> tried to do the go-around thing
	* solves the tangling 
-> randomly go out


// for curliness
-> decrease feed rate, slightly increase jerking dist, increase extrusion
-> (jerking seems not working), back to old way, reso pi/4, 32/(2/0.25) = 4 periods, y_length/1.5 try using delay points 250 ms
-> going to try back and forth circular spin

-> don't add the curly code; just use go around to create curliness
-> add scrapping
-> do a slightly different circle
-> circle faster, larger radius
-> larger radius, 0.75 circle extrude less
-> slower feedrate, scapping back on
-> no, higher feedrate
-> circle towards the end?
-> [sanity check] back to normal

-> add curly function; lower feed rate, extrude a little

------------------------------------------

-> add mid point, dwell before scrapping
-> make end point on scrapper, pause longer

-> retract more
-> fix compensation; increase extrusion
